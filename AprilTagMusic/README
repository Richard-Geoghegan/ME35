# AprilTag Music Game 🎵  

The **AprilTag Music Game** is an interactive smart playground project that blends music, movement, and computational thinking. Using a paddle with an AprilTag, kids can add notes to a queue, visualize them on an 8x32 NeoPixel matrix, and play back their compositions. The game teaches the fundamentals of the **queue data structure (FIFO)** while keeping learning fun and engaging.

## Features 🧩  
- **Add Notes with AprilTags**: Change the tag’s orientation and press “Add” to enqueue a note.  
- **Visual Feedback**: The 8x32 NeoPixel matrix displays each note in real time with colors representing different paddles and pitches.  
- **Playback Animation**: Plays notes by lighting up LEDs in each column to the height of the note's value.  
- **Memory Limit Indication**: When the 32-note limit is reached, the LEDs flash red to indicate memory is full.  
- **Reset Function**: Clears all notes with a wave of red LEDs, representing volatile memory being wiped.  
- **Failsafes**: Prevents adding or resetting during playback to keep the system running smoothly.
