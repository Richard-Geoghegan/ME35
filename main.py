"""
The Motor class controls a motor via PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), manages a NeoPixel (RGB LED),
controls a buzzer, and handles MQTT communication for remote control of the motor's acceleration.
It also connects to Wi-Fi, subscribes to MQTT topics, and processes incoming MQTT messages.

Class Contract:
Inputs:
- pin_pwm (int): The GPIO pin number for motor control using PWM.

Outputs:
- The class initializes components (motor, NeoPixel, buzzer) and connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT broker.
- The class processes MQTT messages to control the motor's behavior (start, stop, adjust speed).
- The motor's acceleration is controlled via PWM signals.

Side Effects:
- Manages NeoPixel colors based on different states (Wi-Fi connected, MQTT connected, etc.).
- Connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT for remote control, and adjusts motor behavior accordingly.
- Continuously checks for incoming MQTT messages to adjust motor speed.
- Resets device states such as NeoPixel color and buzzer when deactivated.
